# :cat: :dog: Pet Clinic Project README :dog: :cat:


Welcome to the Pet Clinic project repository! This project focuses on creating a comprehensive pet clinic management system using the Spring framework. It's my first Spring project, developed as a part of the Udemy course on [Spring Framework 5: Beginner to Guru](https://www.udemy.com/course/spring-framework-5-beginner-to-guru/).

## Project Overview

The Pet Clinic management system is designed to streamline the operations of a veterinary clinic. It enables veterinarians and clinic staff to efficiently manage their appointments, patients (pets), and associated data. The project leverages various Spring technologies to provide a robust and user-friendly application.


## Project Demo

You can access a live demo of the Pet Clinic project here: **[https://pet-clinic-production.up.railway.app/](https://pet-clinic-production.up.railway.app/).**\
Feel free to explore the various features and functionalities.

## Running petclinic locally

Petclinic is a Spring Boot application built using Maven. You can build a jar file and run it from the command line: 

```
git clone https://github.com/JanSiemieniec/Pet-Clinic.git
cd Pet-Clinic
./mvnw package
java -jar target/*.jar
```

**Thank you for your interest in the Pet Clinic project!** :v:
